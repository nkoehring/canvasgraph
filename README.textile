h1. CanvasGraph

Paints simple graphs on a canvas tag.

h3. Configuration options

*background:* The canvas background colour (as CSS colour value)
*foreground:* The line colour (as CSS colour value)

Nothing more, yet.


h3. Usage

All you need is to give your canvas tag an identifier (for example _graph1_) and add this to (the
bottom?) of your page:

bc.
  <script type=text/javascript>
    new Graph('graph1', [1,2,3,4,5]);
  </script>

The second argument contains the data to be plotted. I don't test for invalid values so be sure it is
only contains valid numericals.

To set configuration options, simply add a hash as third argument:
 
bc.
  <script type=text/javascript>
    new Graph('graph1', [1,2,3,4,5], {background: '#CCC', foreground: '#333'});
  </script>


That's it.
